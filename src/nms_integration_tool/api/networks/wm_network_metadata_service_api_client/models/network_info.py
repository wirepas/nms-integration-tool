    Attributes:
        name (str | Unset): Short descriptive name for the metadata resource. If not explicitly set, the system will
            generate the
            name based on the low level identifier of the resource.
        description (str | Unset): More versatile description of the metadata resource. This is optional information,
            i.e. there is no
            default content for this field.
        custom (MetadataBaseObjectCustom | Unset): A freeform dictionary that clients can utilize for storing their own
            metadata related to the managed resource.
            The main intention of the custom fields is to allow clients to manage the relations between the client side data
            objects and corresponding Wirepas NMS data object. Thus, client can e.g. add a custom field for storing the
            internal identifier of managed asset to which the corresponding Wirepas node or gateway is linked to. Naturally,
            as the fields are fully customizable other usage purposes are possible.

            The data management of the custom fields differ slightly from other fields or attributes in managed resources or
            objects. The main difference is that the contents of `custom` field itself shall always be considered as single
            managed field. Thus, when adding new fields as well as when updating or removing existing fields to/from the
            `custom`,
            all the custom fields shall be given. I.e. the provided custom fields directly reflect the end state of the
            whole
            `custom` field after the operation. This is mainly relevant for PATCH update operations, which differ from other
            fields.
        address (int | Unset): Wirepas low level network address for this network (must comply with addressing
            limitations)
